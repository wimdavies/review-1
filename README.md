Help teachers to find out how their students perform on tests
Get a string of comma-separated values (test results)
Like me to generate a simple report

NB: the strings will be "at least" comma-separated. Examples include comma+whitespace, multicomma.

Input:
"Green, Green, Amber, Red, Green"

Return value:
"Green: 3\nAmber: 1\nRed: 1"

- string of each test result type, colon space, number of those results in the input; each type is separated by a newline

"Green,,Green,Red," =>	"Green: 2\nRed: 1"
